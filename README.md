            <h2>A poem for Cynthia Aura</h2>
            <p>
                Roses are red,<br>
                Violets are blue,<br>
                You are so DAMN special,<br>
                And this poem is for you!
            </p>
            <p>
                In the depths of my heart, I must confess<br>
                A moment of thoughtlessness, I must address,<br>
                Aura, my apologies, sincere and true,<br>
                For the pain I caused I deeply rue.
            </p>
            <p>
                You're a radiant soul, like a gentle breeze,<br>
                With a smile that puts my troubled heart at ease.<br>
                In your eyes, I see a world of grace,<br>
                And in your presence, I find solace and embrace.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've made a mistake, and I'm filled with regret,<br>
                For the love we share, I'll never forget.<br>
                Please believe, my dear Aura, it's clear,<br>
                You're special to me, and I hold you near.
            </p>
            <p>
                With these words, I seek your forgiveness,<br>
                For the hurt I've caused, my heart feels distress.<br>
                Know that I love you, beyond any measure,<br>
                And I'll strive to bring you joy and treasure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let our hearts mend, and the past be gone,<br>
                Together we'll build a future that's strong.<br>
                Aura, my love for you will forever endure,<br>
                For in your presence, my heart finds its cure.
            </p>
