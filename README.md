In the depths of my heart, I must confess,
A moment of thoughtlessness, I must address.
Aura, my apologies, sincere and true,
For the pain I've caused, I deeply rue.

You're a radiant soul, like a gentle breeze,
With a smile that puts my troubled heart at ease.
In your eyes, I see a world of grace,
And in your presence, I find solace and embrace.

I've made a mistake, and I'm filled with regret,
For the love we share, I'll never forget.
Please believe, my dear Aura, it's clear,
You're special to me, and I hold you near.

With these words, I seek your forgiveness,
For the hurt I've caused, my heart feels distress.
Know that I love you, beyond any measure,
And I'll strive to bring you joy and treasure.

Let our hearts mend, and the past be gone,
Together we'll build a future that's strong.
Aura, my love for you will forever endure,
For in your presence, my heart finds its cure.
